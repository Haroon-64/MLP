# Different Basics Neural Networks

1. Multi Layer Perceptron
  * simplified implementation of pytorch's MLP

2. Charactor Level Models
   * Bigram Model to Generate Words
   * MLP to do the same
   * WaveNet to further Optimize
3. Decoder Only Transformer
   * Generate unprompted text similar to given dataset
