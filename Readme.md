# Different Basics Neural Networks

1. Multi Layer Perceptron
  * simplified implementation of pytorch's Autograd

2. Charactor Level Models
   * Bigram Model to Generate Words
   * MLP to do the same
   * WaveNet to further Optimize
3. Decoder Only Transformer
   * Generate unprompted text similar to given dataset
4. Gpt 2 model replication 
5. Gpt 2 result replication (pending)
